[**Inductive Failures in Large Reasoning Models: A Game-Theoretic Benchmark**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.xxxxx)  
**Haibo Jin**, Alice Zhang, Jonathan Lee, Mengdi Xu  
[**Project**](https://github.com/haibojin/benchreason)  
- We design a suite of reasoning benchmarks using chess, poker, and dice to reveal consistent inductive errors in LRMs. Our findings challenge the current belief that logic-tuned models outperform general LLMs in structured tasks.
