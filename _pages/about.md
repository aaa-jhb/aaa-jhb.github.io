[**Inductive Failures in Large Reasoning Models: A Game-Theoretic Benchmark**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.xxxxx)  
**Haibo Jin**, Alice Zhang, Jonathan Lee, Mengdi Xu  
[**Project**](https://github.com/haibojin/benchreason)  
- We design a suite of reasoning benchmarks using chess, poker, and dice to reveal consistent inductive errors in LRMs. Our findings challenge the current belief that logic-tuned models outperform general LLMs in structured tasks.

[**Attention Collapse in Multimodal Transformers: A Diagnostic View**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.xxxxx)  
**Haibo Jin**, Shuo Wang, Maria Lopez  
[**Code**](https://github.com/haibojin/multimodal-collapse)  
- We uncover attention collapse as a critical failure mode in large vision-language models. Through gradient similarity and entropy analysis, we explain how visual dominance reduces reasoning capacity in aligned transformers.

[**Adaptive Adversarial Training for Robust Vision-Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.xxxxx)  
**Haibo Jin**, Xinyu Ma, Kevin Chen  
[**Dataset**](https://github.com/haibojin/vlm-adv)  
- We propose an adversarial fine-tuning framework that adapts to gradient-sensitive tokens in multimodal inputs. Our model achieves SOTA robustness on VQAv2 under strong perturbations.

[**Controlling RAG Models with Rule-Guided Prompt Injections**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.xxxxx)  
**Haibo Jin**, Yifan Zhou, Linjie Sun  
[**Code**](https://github.com/haibojin/rag-injection)  
- We show that retrieval-augmented generation models are vulnerable to rule-based prompt injections. Our method uses controllable distractors to test hallucination boundaries and trust calibration.

[**A Taxonomy of Reasoning Errors in Large Language Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.xxxxx)  
**Haibo Jin**, Rachel Li, Yichuan Yang  
[**Paper site**](https://haibojin.ai/reasoning-taxonomy)  
- We categorize over 5,000 model generations into nine distinct reasoning failure modes. The taxonomy serves as a diagnostic scaffold for evaluating and improving CoT-based prompting strategies.
